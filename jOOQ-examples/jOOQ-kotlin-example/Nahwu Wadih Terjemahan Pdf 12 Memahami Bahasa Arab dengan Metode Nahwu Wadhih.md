Nahwu Wadhih is a popular book for learning Arabic grammar that was written by two Egyptian linguists, Dr. Mustafa Amin and Dr. Ali Al-Jarim. The book consists of three volumes that cover the basic rules of Arabic syntax (nahwu) in a clear and systematic way. The book is suitable for beginners who want to learn Arabic quickly and easily.
 
However, some learners may find it difficult to understand the book without a translation or an explanation in their native language. That is why there are several versions of Nahwu Wadhih that include a translation in Indonesian, English or other languages. These versions can help learners to grasp the meaning and application of the Arabic grammar rules more effectively.
