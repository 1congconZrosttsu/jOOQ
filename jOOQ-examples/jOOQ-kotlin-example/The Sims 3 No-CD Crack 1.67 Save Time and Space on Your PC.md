This article presents the International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR) dataset for the reporting of ovarian carcinoma. The ICCR is a not-for-profit organization that aims to develop standardized, evidence-based and internationally agreed-upon datasets for the pathology reporting of cancer. The ICCR datasets are intended to promote consistent and accurate reporting of cancer, facilitate research and audit, and improve patient care and outcomes.

The ICCR dataset for ovarian carcinoma was developed by a panel of 12 experts from 8 countries, representing different regions and practice settings. The panel reviewed the existing literature and guidelines on ovarian carcinoma pathology reporting, and consulted with various stakeholders, including pathologists, oncologists, surgeons, radiologists, patients and advocacy groups. The panel also considered the feedback from an open consultation process that involved more than 200 pathologists from 31 countries.
  
The ICCR dataset for ovarian carcinoma consists of 38 core (mandatory) and 13 non-core (optional) data elements that cover the essential information for the diagnosis, classification, staging and prognostication of ovarian carcinoma. The dataset also provides guidance on specimen handling, macroscopic and microscopic examination, immunohistochemistry and molecular testing, and report format and terminology. The dataset is applicable to all types of ovarian carcinoma, including epithelial, germ cell, sex cord-stromal and metastatic tumors.
