The examples in this repository depend on the latest snapshot version of the jOOQ Open Source Edition, and in some cases, of the commercial distributions. In order to run the examples, you can either:

- Build the snapshot version first
- Replace the snapshot version references from the various `pom.xml` files by the latest published version

To build the jOOQ snapshot version, check out this repository and run the following set of commands:

```
$ pwd
/path/to/checkout/dir
$ mvn clean install
```
